### What is the map?

As part of the CHARTER Horizon 2020 consortium, we systematically mapped out the existing evidence for temporal dynamics of Arctic biodiversity over the last 12,000 years (until 1950 AD). For identified relevant evidence, we noted its temporal, spatial, and taxonomic properties, alongside other metadata.

The contents of the map <a target="_blank" href="https://acm.im/holocene-arctic-biodiversity-map/ahbdb_sites/">may be viewed as a geographical map here.</a>

### The Arctic Holocene Biodiversity Database

The Arctic Holocene Biodiversity Database (AHBDB) is a comprehensive collation of the existing evidence of temporal variability in Arctic biodiversity during the last 12,000 years.

We expanded the systematic map to be able to include underlying digitised datasets from literature sources, such as pollen data digitised from pollen diagrams.
